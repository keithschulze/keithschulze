You may have noticed that this blog is proudly powered by Hakyll. [A number of others](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/examples.html) have already posted about transitioning blogs to Hakyll, but I thought I'd recount my experience anyway.

I won't cover RSS and process

## NPM and Bootstrap

## Rendering tags a little differently

## Bootstrapifying tables

One of the first things I realised was that I could enhance table quite a lot with a little help from Bootstrap.

Initially I thought I could post process the HTML produced by the `pandocCompiler` using RegExp.

```haskell
processTables :: String -> String
processTables i =
  replaceAll "\n<table(.|\n)+</table>\n" processTable i

processTable :: String -> String
processTable ts
  | [_, attr, body]:_ <- ts =~ ("\n<table(.*)>(.+)</table>\n" :: String) :: [[String]] =
    "\n<div class=\"table-responsive-md\">\n<table " ++ attr ++ " class=\"table table-striped table-dark\">" ++ body ++ "</table>\n</div>\n"
  | otherwise = ts
```

But, I pretty soon realised that this was going to be a pretty fruitless game when multiple tables were present. Being POSIX regexps--I realise I could switch to the PCRE Perl compatible RegExp engine--

In the end, I decided this was going to be messy.

Some intuition came from the `relativizeUrls` function, which use `tagsoup` to parse HTML and process each tag. Adding the `table table-striped table-dark` class attributes to each table was dead easy:

```haskell
withBootstrapTables :: String -> String
withBootstrapTables = withTags tag
    where
        tag (TS.TagOpen "table" attrs) = TS.TagOpen "table" (attrs ++ [("class","table table-striped table-dark")])
        tag x = x
```

Note: I should note that TS in the code block above and those below come from the import `import qualified Text.HTML.TagSoup as TS`.
This maps over each tag using `withTags :: (TS.Tag String -> TS.Tag String) -> String -> String`, matches the `TS.TagOpen` tags with a name "table and add the `table table-striped table-dark` class attribute.

Making tables responsive is a slightly more tricky problem because we can just add new tags around a table using the `withTags` function. Turns out Hakyll recently added a related function `withTagList :: ([TS.Tag String] -> [TS.Tag String]) -> String -> String`. In this case, we need to provide a function that takes as input a list of all the Tags and returns a list of Tags.
