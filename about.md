## 9 things to know about me

1. I'm a biologist turned developer and bio-image informatician.

2. I'm a big fan of typed functional programming. I mostly use Scala,
but I'd love an opportunity to use Haskell / Rust / PureScript / OCaml at some point.

3. While it kills me a little inside sometimes (see 2.), I still enjoy writing Python,
   Java, Clojure, R and others.

4. I'm keen on data--analysing, moving, organising, cleaning, visualing.

5. I live in Melbourne, Australia.

6. I currently work at MYOB, where I help to develop platforms for data management and analytics.

7. I like sport--I run quite a lot and I'd like to start playing touch rugby and surfing again now that my knee is in better shape.

8. You can reach me by em@il at keith dot schulze at gmail.com.

9. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/keithschulze) and
