title: 9 things to know about me
---

1. I'm a biologist turned bio-image informatician and data engineer.

2. I'm a fan of typed functional programming. I mostly use Scala,
but I'd love an opportunity to use Haskell / Rust / PureScript / OCaml at some point.

3. While it kills me a little inside sometimes, I still enjoy writing
Clojure, R, Python, Java and others (in that order).

4. I like data! Analysing, moving, organising, cleaning and visualing all kinds of data gets me up in the morning.

5. I live in Melbourne, Australia.

6. I currently work at MYOB, where I help to build and operate platforms for data management and analytics.

7. I enjoy playing sport--I've been known to run a little at lunch time.

8. You can reach me by em@il at keith dot schulze at gmail dot com.

9. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/keithschulze) and
